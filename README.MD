## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!  If you want to contribute, ask for access to the repository in the #javelin-friends slack channel.  Please do all work from a branch and not a fork so that our e2e repository tests and other pr checks will work as intended.  Additionally we ask that you follow the husky prompts in their entirety (choosing what kind of change you're doing, specifying your ticket number, adding a short description for the change).
